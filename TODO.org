#+TITLE: Known bugs, issues, feature requests, wishful thinking

* TODO Demote splitted headlines to level 1
* TODO Split at headlines with given property (tag?)
* TODO Optimize otm/title-to-filename,
so that it doesn't count from scratch each time a name conflict is resolved
* TODO Check `org-map-entries' instead of `org-element-map'
